## 🧠 Python_Basic_Concepts

Covers all the fundamentals needed for writing clean, efficient, and error-free Python code:

- Data Types, Variables, Operators  
- Control Structures: Loops, Conditionals  
- Functions & OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- Strings, Lists, Tuples, Multithreading  
- File Handling, Web Data Scraping  

These basics form the backbone of data manipulation, algorithm writing, and ML workflows.

---

## 🔄 Practice Problem

A collection of structured practice folders to reinforce core concepts:

- 🔣 Pattern printing challenges  
- 💡 Logic building with conditionals & loops  
- 🧩 Functions and reusability  
- 🧠 OOP-based problem solving  
- 📂 File handling and manipulation  

Perfect for self-practice, debugging exercises, and mock interviews.

---

## 🧪 Mini Projects

Small but impactful projects to solidify logic & creativity:

- 🧮 CLI Calculator  
- 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game  
- 🧠 KBC-style Quiz Game  
- ➗ Simple Arithmetic Calculator  

These help in gaining confidence with real-world-style CLI applications.

---

## 💼 Python Projects

More advanced projects for real-world problem solving:

- 🏦 CLI Banking System (with CRUD logic)  
- 🌦️ Weather Info CLI using APIs  
- 🌐 Web Data Scraper using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`  
- 📺 YouTube Video Manager (with and without database support)  

Each project improves grasp on file handling, APIs, data storage, and backend logic — preparing for full-fledged ML app integration.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repo  
2. Navigate to the `Python_Basic` folder  
3. Run `.py` files via terminal or your IDE  
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts or explore/modify the code as needed

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Most scripts use standard Python 3 libraries.  
If any external modules are needed (like `requests` or `bs4`), install them via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
